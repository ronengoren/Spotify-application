# Hello Spotify!

A small brief about this project.

This my first project ever in ReactJS. Right after I received the assignment I did a lot of reasearch on which language has the best approach to achieve what I wanted, so I decided to take a risk so I self taught my self with this new platform for the past 2 weeks.

This project unfortunately havenâ€™t reached to its limits in terms of the assignment, BUT, has its own achievements I believe.

Beside fully working rails API that functionaly able to create and delete events, display organized (I think so.. ) functioning calendar which could render views for 12 months, a submit form to create events with working call to backend, and I also decided to add something for the sake of practice and curiosity, so I built a fully working feature using MUSIXMATCH API to generate a random song released on the same day the user has clicked on. there is a hard coded text redirecting the user to Spotify to listen to this random song - a feature Spotify API are offering in their API queries.

I hope you enjoyed the app!

Thanks!
